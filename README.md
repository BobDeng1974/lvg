LVG (Lion Vector Graphics)
==========

nanoVG + nanoSVG + glfw3 + libtcc + Emscripten =
LVG is lightweight replacement for flash.
It's designed to use very small runtime (around 200kb) for player and can run on android, ios, web and more.
It's uses C scripts natively and javascript for web.

Why C scripts? Because C compiler is small, and runtime written in C, so no other lagnuage needed and script can be compiled in to save space.
